# Code Challenge 2
## Complete Google.com Relica

In this challenge I was able to recreate a non-working replica of the search page Google. After forking the project to my github account I worked to add the sections that compliment the header that had been started. I continued the pattern of divided sections in an attempt to maintain uniformity throughout the page. This help me build the remaining features missing from the orignal repo. 

This challenge was uselful in helping solidfy my understanding of fundenmental elements and propeties the basic programming langauges. While making good use of 'div', 'input', 'display: flex;', and 'margin' the page was able to come together. 

* added search bar with google image above it
* added buttons below searched styled to mimick click-abilty
* added footer section it's included links 

The challenge is great practice for any novice programer.
